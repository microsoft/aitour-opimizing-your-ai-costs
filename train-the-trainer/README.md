## Tips for this session
- The PowerPoint session delivery includes tips for speakers and also talking points to tell the audience. You don't need to follow the script exactly. Understand the intention of each slide and put it in your own words.
- Depending on your background and experience, there may be topics or products in this session that you are unfamiliar with. Take a look at the PowerPoint deck and use the Learn more resources for areas you want to learn more about.
- The demo recordings include a narration which covers the most important things to be explaining during the demo.
- The demo recordings that are silent have also had any pauses removed. This is deliberate, so you don't have to fit your narration into the author's timings. It is highly recommended that you use these recordings, and control the start/stop of the video with your space bar. With practice, this is an effective way to give you as much time as you need to describe things onscreen.
- You can do this talk without using the demo recordings, but it makes it harder, especially if your venue has overloaded internet and Copilot throws some unexpected responses. There are no medals for doing live demos. However, if you wish to attempt to, you'll find step by step instructions in the demo walkthrough document, including deployment and setup guidance.
